          <h4>What is PoolBNB?</h4>
          <p>
            PoolBNB is a platform that connects hosts and guests through private
            pool-side events and experiences. Create an event, invite people, or
            discover unique gatherings near you.
          </p>

          <!-- this is all just a bunch of filler, but we have tried to make it look as professional as possible-->
          <h4>Who can use PoolBNB?</h4>
          <p>
            You must be 18 years or older to host or book. Some events may
            require verification if requested by the host.
          </p>

          <h4>How do I create an account?</h4>
          <p>
            Click <em>Register</em> and complete the form. You can then log in,
            create events, and book experiences immediately.
          </p>

          <h4>How do I create an event?</h4>
          <p>
            Go to <em>Create Event</em>, add title, date, capacity, price,
            amenities (e.g., heated or indoor), and house rules. Publish to make
            it discoverable.
          </p>

          <h4>Can I reschedule or cancel my booking?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, availability depends on the host's policy. You can request a
            date change in <em>My Bookings</em>. Cancellations follow the event's
            listed cancellation window.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- column 2 -->
        <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
          <h4>How do payments work?</h4>
          <p>
            Guests pay securely at checkout. Funds are held until the event
            start, then released to the host (minus platform fees) within 3-5
            business days.
          </p>

          <h4>What is the refund policy?</h4>
          <p>
            Refunds follow the host's cancellation policy. If an event is
            cancelled by the host or due to verified severe weather, guests
            receive a full refund.
          </p>

          <h4>Safety and House Rules</h4>
          <p>
            Each event lists its own rules (capacity limits, alcohol policy,
            noise curfew, no-glass near pool, etc.). By booking, you agree to
            follow them. Hosts may remove guests who break rules.
          </p>

          <h4>Weather</h4>
          <p>
            Hosts can specify a wet-weather plan (reschedule or covered area).
            If severe weather makes the event unsafe and no alternative is
            possible, bookings are refunded.
          </p>

          <h4>Damage and Liability</h4>
          <p>
            Guests are responsible for any damage they cause. Hosts should
            disclose any security deposit or bond in the listing. For incidents,
            contact support immediately.
